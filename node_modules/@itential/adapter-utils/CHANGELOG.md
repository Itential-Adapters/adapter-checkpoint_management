##  [09-06-2018]
### Improvement
* Changes to add functionality, and allow multiple path variables, to the URI path as well as make it simpler.  [PH-16970](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-16970)

# Current Version: 4.3.0 [03-22-2019]

## New Features
* __3.10.0 [12-05-2018]__ - New methods have been add to:

support failover - there is a method (setFailover) that can be called by adapters to get the proper failover code.
support verifying capabilities - there is a method (verifyCapability) which will verify that the adapter supports the entity, action and specific entities (Array).
support caching entities - the verifyCapability used a cache of entities. This cache can be 'local' memory or in 'redis' based on the cache_location property. You can add entity lists into the cache using the addEntityCache method.
 [PH-21980](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-21980)
* __3.9.0 [12-04-2018]__ - The external name on schemas can now be at the same level or lower -- 
It can still be sys_id or it can be something like ticket.sys_id this allows translation to be done at different levels. [PH-20788](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20788)
* __3.6.0 [11-16-2018]__ - The process to check the action files for validity has been moved into adapter-utils to reduce the code in the adapter-template. This also moves the actionSchema.json into the adapter-utils. [PH-20797](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20797)
* __3.5.0 [11-16-2018]__ - Removed the requirement for the properties -authentication.token_URI_path, healthcheck.URI_path and healthcheck.protocol. These can now be taken care of in the .system entity. [PH-20778](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20778)
* __2.1.0 [08-17-2018]__ - These libraries now support token re-use and expiration during the calls to the external system. [PH-14296](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-14296)
* __2.0.0 [08-13-2018]__ - The following issues are in this Sprint Branch 
PH-16044 -- Add Generic call that is protocol and method independent
PH-16024 -- Mock data should not have to include the internal response information
PH-16125 -- Add Proxy capability to the connection
PH-15075 -- Support Base64 encoding on authentication
PH-14311 -- Adapter not returning errors on two phase calls (need to get token and then make call) and it is then running the second call.
PH-16053 -- Ability to encrypt/decrypt properties (passwords)
PH-16141 -- converted actions to an array and removed redundant data from response object
PH-16239 -- Change the path to read {} instead of <> when going through the entitypath
PH-16268 -- Change the type in the action.json response as single and multiple are confusing
PH-15718 -- Consistent returns that include status and code [PH-16131](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-16131)

## Improvements
* __4.2.1 [03-19-2019]__ - Updated calls to support MongoDB driver 3.1.7. [PH-28266](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-28266)
* __4.2.0 [02-25-2019]__ - Added getAllCapability call for IAP
Added refreshProperties so the adapter can take in new properties without having to restart it. [PH-24808](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-24808)
* __4.0.0 [02-08-2019]__ - Adapter-utils changed error and response objects to match the new standard. This is a breaking change so when using this with your adapter, make sure you handle these new objects. [PH-25372](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-25372)
* __3.13.2 [01-16-2019]__ - Added other REST Methods that were not available - OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT. [PH-24158](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-24158)

* __3.11.0 [01-02-2019]__ - Added the capability to have a timeout per action defined in the action.js. This timeout overrides the attempt_timeout property when it is provided. [PH-22466](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-22466)
* __3.7.0 [11-16-2018]__ - Adapter can now use expiration time returned on a token request for when the token expires. In addition, tokens can be stored in either local memory or redis. The later will survive an adapter restart. [PH-20803](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20803)
* __3.4.0 [11-09-2018]__ - Adds an icode field to the error returns that will be used to determine if the request can be failed over to another adapter or not. [PH-20677](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-20677)
* __3.3.0 [10-12-2018]__ - Adapter-utils now supports defining the healthcheck and token in either the properties or in their own action files. [PH-18536](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-18536)
* __3.2.0 [09-26-2018]__ - Added support for version parameter on the entitypath for an action and a property so that the version only needs to be changed in a property. [PH-18530](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-18530)
* __3.1.0 [09-26-2018]__ - Added the ability to bypass translation on the returned data. [PH-17702](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-17702)

# Previous Version: 1.3.2 [08-03-2018]

## New Features
* 1.2.0 [07-03-2018] Added the ability to define separate request and response schemas for an action. Three potential fields on each action in the action.json:
  - schema - this remains the best way to define a single schema for the action
  - requestSchema - this supersedes schema for requests going to the external sytem
  - responseSchema - this supersedes schema for requests coming from the external system. [PH-12811](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-12811)
* 1.1.0 [06-25-2018] Added the ability for the data translator utility to handle objects with dynamic fields. [PH-12808](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-12808)
* 1.0.19 [06-08-2018] Update CHANGELOG to reflect new format [PH-11323](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-11323)

* 1.3.0 [07-10-2018] Changes how the mock data files are defined to remove redundancy in the action.json. They are now defined on the responseObject in the mockFile field and the mockFiles Array is gone. [PH-13483](http://itential.atlassian.net/browse/PH-13483)
